# It’s time to refuse<br />your rent increase!

In Québec, landlords are only entitled to increase residential rents **at most** by a certain percentage. This percentage is calculated for each unit of housing based on amounts such as the landlord’s total revenue for the building, the amount of municipal and school tax they pay, and improvements or repairs they’ve made over the past year.

**Many landlords issue rent increases far in excess of this calculated amount.** The Comité logement de la Petite Patrie estimates that in the neighbourhood of Petite Patrie, [**the average acceptable rent increase for this year should not exceed $1.00**](https://comitelogementpetitepatrie.org/vos-droits/outil-calcul-hausse-loyer-2021/). If your landlord issues a rent increase larger than the maximum allowed amount and you accept it, you may be obligated to continue to pay it even if you later realize that it should have been lower.

**You have the right to refuse** an increase that is in excess of the calculated maximum permissible amount. Your landlord will then need to propose a lower amount, or ask the Tribunal du logement to intervene and decide the final increase. **You may even be entitled to a decrease in rent** as a result of changes in tax and energy rates. As a tenant, there’s no risk to you in refusing this increase — at worst you’ll be informed that it’s within the permissible increase amount for your dwelling.
