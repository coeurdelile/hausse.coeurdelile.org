**You have the right to refuse a rent increase!** The Tribunal administratif du logement offers a [standard notice format](https://www.tal.gouv.qc.ca/sites/default/files/notices/TAL_810A_E.pdf) you can print and deliver to your landlord by registered mail. **You must reply within one month of receiving the notice of increase.**

**If you need help**, contact your local comité logement or tenants' association, or get in touch with us! See below.

This tool is based on the [estimation sheet](https://comitelogementpetitepatrie.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hausse2021.pdf) created by the [Comité logement de la Petite Patrie](https://comitelogementpetitepatrie.org/).
